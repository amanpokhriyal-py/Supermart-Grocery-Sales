### Electric-Vehicle-sales-by-state-in-India ###


This dataset is valuable for analysts, data scientists, and researchers aiming to
understand electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends across India. It is versatile and ideal
for geographic market segmentation, trend analysis, and predictive modeling. By
offering insights into regional EV sales patterns, the dataset supports strategic
decision-making in market planning and infrastructure investment.
The data was meticulously scraped from the Clean Mobility Shift website, and then
thoroughly preprocessed to ensure accuracy and relevance. All null values have been
removed, and the dataset has been cleaned to prepare it for immediate use in
exploration, visualization, and analytical projects. It is particularly valuable for market
trend analysis, infrastructure planning, and policy development within the EV sector.
The dataset is provided in CSV format and is ready for analysis.
